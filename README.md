# Learn Kotlin Flow by real examples for Android

## About this project:

* This project is for someone who wants to get started with Kotlin Flow.
* I have tried to add the examples we implement in our Android project frequently.

## About me

Hi, I am [**Amit Shekhar**](https://amitshekhar.me), I have mentored many developers, and their efforts landed them high-paying tech jobs, helped many tech companies in solving their unique problems, and created many open-source libraries being used by top companies. I am passionate about sharing knowledge through open-source, blogs, and videos.

## Steps to learn Kotlin Flow from this project

First, we need to learn the concepts. 

I have written a series of blogs on **Flow API in Kotlin**:

- [Mastering Flow API inÂ Kotlin](https://amitshekhar.me/blog/flow-api-in-kotlin)
- [Creating Flow Using Flow Builder in Kotlin](https://amitshekhar.me/blog/creating-flow-using-flow-builder-in-kotlin)
- [Terminal Operators in Kotlin Flow](https://amitshekhar.me/blog/terminal-operators-in-kotlin-flow)
- [Cold Flow vs Hot Flow](https://amitshekhar.me/blog/cold-flow-vs-hot-flow)
- [StateFlow and SharedFlow](https://amitshekhar.me/blog/stateflow-and-sharedflow)
- [Long-running tasks in parallel with Kotlin Flow](https://amitshekhar.me/blog/long-running-tasks-in-parallel-with-kotlin-flow)
- [Retry Operator in Kotlin Flow](https://amitshekhar.me/blog/retry-operator-in-kotlin-flow)
- [Retrofit with Kotlin Flow](https://amitshekhar.me/blog/retrofit-with-kotlin-flow)
- [Room Database with Kotlin Flow](https://amitshekhar.me/blog/room-database-with-kotlin-flow)
- [Kotlin Flow Zip Operator for Parallel Multiple Network Calls](https://amitshekhar.me/blog/kotlin-flow-zip-operator-parallel-multiple-network-calls)
- [Instant Search Using Kotlin Flow Operators](https://amitshekhar.me/blog/instant-search-using-kotlin-flow-operators)
- [callbackFlow - Callback to Flow API in Kotlin](https://amitshekhar.me/blog/callback-to-flow-api-in-kotlin)
- [Exception Handling in Kotlin Flow](https://amitshekhar.me/blog/exception-handling-in-kotlin-flow)
- [Unit Testing ViewModel with Kotlin Flow and StateFlow](https://amitshekhar.me/blog/unit-testing-viewmodel-with-kotlin-flow-and-stateflow)

Then, just clone, build, run the project and start learning Kotlin Flow by examples.
